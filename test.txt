            Description:5 Things To Consider When Visiting DubaiDecide when to visit Dubai -  Dubai's climate can be scorching. So if you plan to take a vacation, it is best to visit Dubai between October and April as it is the winter season. It is also the perfect beach weather during that time. Make sure you book your flights and hotels in advance, as Dubai is a popular vacation spot.Keep your outfits modest -  Since Dubai is a Muslim country, you should dress modestly in public and adhere to the dress code when visiting a Mosque.   Think conservative over revealing clothes when packing your holiday clothes. Women's overly short, tight, or transparent attire is considered indecent. In contrast, men should never go out without a shirt on. Respect the Muslim tradition by dressing modestly to prevent unwanted attention.Visiting during Ramadan -  Respect the Muslims and their fasting practices if you visit during the holy month of Ramadan, which falls in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Between sunrise and sunset, you are not permitted to eat, drink, or smoke in front of them. Make sure you respect the local tradition.Be careful with alcohol -  In Dubai, alcohol is permitted; nevertheless, you cannot drink in public because public intoxication and drinking and driving are both illegal. You can't buy alcohol for personal consumption without a permit, and you have to get it from a licensed facility. It's fine to purchase beverages in a pub or restaurant; don't try to leave drunk.Social rules for couples  - There are various social rules in Dubai, including the prohibition of public displays of affection such as kissing or even holding hands. Unmarried couples usually are not allowed to stay in a hotel room together. Thus, hotels may require couples to provide a marriage license. Dubai is a Muslim country, and its laws reflect that Islamic rituals continue to be followed. As a result, make sure you don't make any public displays of affection.Sources10 things to know before you arrive in Dubai  - IHG MARIKA KAZIMIERSKA,  20 Surprising (But Important) Things To Keep In Mind Before Traveling To Dubai  -The Travel, 2018 15 Things Not To Do In Dubai Or You'll Land In Deep Trouble On Your Vacay In 2022  - Travel Triangle 15 Things Not To Do In Dubai Or You'll Land In Deep Trouble On Your Vacay In 2022  - Holidify Tourists in Dubai – Your Do's and Don'ts For Visiting Dubai  My Bayut
